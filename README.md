# Writefreely Previewer
A browser extension to preview your posts

This extension is in **beta**.

## **Privacy Notice**
This extension currently makes requests to pencil.writefree.ly with the contents of your post, that api then returns the HTML version for rendering. In future we intend to have the extension make requests against the current instance where possible.

> Click 'This Firefox' and click 'Load Temporary Add On', select the manifest file in the repo root.
